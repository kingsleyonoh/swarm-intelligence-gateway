# Swarm Intelligence Gateway — Coding Standards: Live & E2E Testing

> Part 3 of 4. Also loaded: `CODING_STANDARDS.md`, `CODING_STANDARDS_TESTING.md` (core TDD), `CODING_STANDARDS_DOMAIN.md`
> This file covers mock policy, integration testing, and E2E testing.

## Live Integration Testing (Mock Policy)

### The Rule: Don't Mock What You Own
If you control the service and can run it locally → test against the real thing.

### Service Fallback Hierarchy
When deciding how to test a service, follow this order:
1. **Local instance** (best) — Docker, CLI, emulator on your machine
2. **Cloud dev instance** (good) — dedicated test project / staging environment
3. **Mock** (last resort) — only when options 1 and 2 are impossible

### Test LIVE (Never Mock)
- Your database (local PostgreSQL + pgvector, local Redis) — validates schema, column names, constraints, query behavior
- Your own API endpoints — call the actual route, not a stub
- Your own server actions / business logic — test the real function
- File storage you control (local filesystem, local object storage)

### Mock ONLY These
- Third-party payment APIs (Stripe charges money)
- Email/SMS delivery (SendGrid/Twilio sends messages)
- Rate-limited external APIs you don't control
- Services with irreversible side effects
- Cloud-only services with no local emulator AND no dev tier

### No Services? No Problem
If the project has no external services (CLI tool, library, static site), this policy doesn't apply — just write standard unit tests.

### Why This Matters
A mock that returns `{ user_id: 1 }` will pass even when the real column is `userId`. A mock that returns success will pass even when the real constraint rejects your data. Mocks test your ASSUMPTIONS about the service. Live tests test REALITY.

### Common Mock Violations (DO NOT DO THESE)
- ❌ Mocking your database client to return fake rows — hit the real database
- ❌ Mocking your own API routes with `nock`/`msw` — call the real endpoint via test client
- ❌ Using an in-memory SQLite when production uses PostgreSQL — use the real PostgreSQL
- ❌ Mocking Redis/cache when it's running in Docker — connect to the real instance
- ✅ Mocking Stripe's charge API — you don't want to charge real money in tests
- ✅ Mocking SendGrid — you don't want to send real emails in tests
- ✅ Mocking an external API with rate limits — you don't control their uptime

### Test Cleanup
- Each test MUST clean up after itself (delete rows, reset state)
- Use transactions with rollback when possible for speed

## Backend API & Integration Testing

> The backend is a Fastify API with BullMQ workers. The frontend is vanilla TypeScript (WorldMonitor fork) — no React, no RTL.

### When to Write API Integration Tests
- Every **API endpoint**: test request → response cycle with real HTTP semantics
- Every **message consumer/handler**: test event processing with real or local message broker
- Every **background job/worker**: test job execution with actual service dependencies
- Every **middleware**: test request interception, auth guards, validation layers

### What to Test
| Priority | Test This | Example |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Request/response cycle | POST /api/users → 201, returns created user |
| 2 | Input validation | Missing required field → 400 with specific error |
| 3 | Auth & authorization | No token → 401; wrong role → 403 |
| 4 | Error handling | Invalid ID → 404; DB constraint → 409 |
| 5 | Edge cases | Empty body, oversized payload, duplicate submission |

### API Testing Patterns
- Use Fastify `inject()` for integration tests — test full request lifecycle
- Assert on status codes, response body structure, AND headers where relevant
- Test pagination, filtering, and sorting with real DB rows

### Message/Event Consumer Testing
- Publish test events to a local Redis (BullMQ queue)
- Assert the consumer processes them correctly (DB writes, side effects)
- Test error handling: malformed events, duplicate events, consumer restart

### File Naming & Location
- Name: `module-name.test.ts` — in `tests/` mirror of source structure
- Group shared test helpers in `tests/helpers/` or `tests/factories/`

## E2E Testing (Real Endpoints)

> E2E tests hit a RUNNING server over HTTP — not in-process test clients like `inject()`.
> The point is testing the deployed stack: server startup, middleware chain, database, cache, and response serialization.
> These catch issues that unit/integration tests miss: port binding, CORS headers, middleware ordering, connection pool behavior under load.

### When E2E is Required
- **Any batch that creates or modifies an API endpoint** → E2E MUST hit the running server
- **Pure utility/library/config batches with no endpoints** → E2E not required (skip with note)
- **`[SETUP]` items** → E2E not required unless the setup itself starts a server

### E2E Test Architecture

**Backend E2E (API projects):**
1. Start the actual server: `npm run dev` (NOT a test-mode in-process server)
2. Wait for ready signal (health check passes)
3. Hit real endpoints via HTTP (fetch or undici)
4. Assert on status codes, response bodies, headers
5. Stop the server after tests complete

**Requires local services running** (Docker PostgreSQL + pgvector, Redis) — aligns with the mock policy ("Don't Mock What You Own").

### E2E Test File Structure
```
tests/e2e/
  api/                        ← Backend E2E tests
    auth.e2e.test.ts          ← Auth endpoint tests
    simulations.e2e.test.ts   ← Simulation endpoint tests
  helpers/
    server.ts                 ← Start/stop server utilities
    seed.ts                   ← Test data seeding
```

### E2E vs Integration Tests
| Aspect | Integration (Fastify inject) | E2E (running server) |
|--------|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| Server | In-process, no real HTTP | Real HTTP, real port |
| Speed | Fast (~1ms per test) | Slower (~100ms+ per test) |
| What it catches | Handler logic, validation, DB | Middleware ordering, CORS, startup, ports |
| When to use | Every endpoint (RED/GREEN phase) | After REGRESSION passes (Step 7d) |
| Run command | `npm test` | `npm run test:e2e` |

**Both are required.** Integration tests are your fast feedback loop (TDD). E2E tests are your deployment confidence check.

### E2E Test Cleanup
- Each E2E test must clean up its own data (delete created records, reset state)
- Use a dedicated test database or schema to avoid polluting dev data
- Kill the server process reliably in the `afterAll` hook — leaked processes block ports
